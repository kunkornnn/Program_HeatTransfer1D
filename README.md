# How to use
This is a example you can set the variables as follows:

**WARNING** : Beware about the UNIT!!

# Graph

If you choose a graph result, you will need to enter a value "Time period of each line"

![](imageREADME/Fill_Graph.PNG)

_From the picture, Time period of each line is equal to 1200 seconds._

If you enter the variable values mentioned above You will get **results** like this:

![](imageREADME/Result_Graph.PNG)

_From the picture, This is a Graph result._

# Animation
If you want animation result You just click the animation button and wait a moment.
